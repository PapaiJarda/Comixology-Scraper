# Comixology Scraper

Download zip from [Mylar](https://github.com/SenorSmartyPants/Comixology-Scraper/tree/mylar) or [ComicRack](https://github.com/SenorSmartyPants/Comixology-Scraper/tree/ComicRack) branches. Each one is tuned to work with the respective program.

Currently Comixology Scraper depends on some metadata already existing for the comic archive being scraped. This metadata is used to verify the match.

Edit config.py to change what is scraped and overwrite behavior.

I primarily use this to grab genres from comixology.

There is no progress bar yet in comicrack, just a pop up when finished. And also console output.
